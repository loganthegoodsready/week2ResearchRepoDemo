# Reflective Journal

## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
It is a fun visual programming language that is used to create interactive games and stories. The concept of stacking blocks makes it intuitive and helps the user understanding progamming principles.

### What is visual programming?
A visual programming language is any programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.

### If you were describing programming to someone who knows nothing about it, what would you say?

"Programming is simply a set of instructions to tell a computer how to perform a particular task". Programming languges are used as the "set of instructions", and there are many languages that have their own "syntax", but they all share the same purpose. There are 'low level' and 'high level' languages, the former being closer "machine code"  which the computer for can process directly (Computers understand 0's and 1's - binary - exclusively), and the latter being closer to noraml "human" language.  

### What are some of the programming principles you've discovered?

Programming conventions - common rules, guidelines and approaches for programming languages - are the begining of the "programming principles" I'm becoming familiar with. 'Standard libraries' which defines the built-in functions and modules for a particular language are an important aspect of high level languages. "Style guides", seem to be synonymous with "syntax" so I may need to follow up on that if it's important. Variables are storage boxes for information, and each varibale stores just one piece of information, but can be updated. They store data types which can be numeric, text (strings) or booleans (True or False values). 
 "A flowchart is a simple diagram that illustrates the stages or steps the computer must complete to solve the problem". These visual representations of code are easier to grasp than normal written code. Scratch is similar to a flow chart in many ways. seeing the visual elements of flow charts such as sequence, condition and itteration, make 'control flow' concepts like "while loops" in 'Python'(or any other language) easier to understand. 
 K.I.S.S - Short, concise and coherent code is optimal as it's quicker to write and read. "code is read more than it's written"- Said many people.


### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Yes i can.

## Week 2:

### What is git?
A dictionary defines a 'git' as "an unpleasant or contemptible person".
or "Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development."

### What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. A developer can duplicate part of the source code (called the repository). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.

### Click [Here](https://github.com/loganthegoodsready/Mangoisgreat.git) to see my attempts at the lab activities for week3/4.

### What is an IDE?

IDE stands for and integrated develompment environment. It provides the user interface for code development, testing and debugging. The IDE I have benn using is called Pycharm, and It's very easy to use. I may have to swith to another IDE such as Visual studio code as I plan to learn other programming languages that wont run in Pycharm. 

### What is Python?

Python is a high level, object orientated programming language. It has a very simple sytax that is similar to the normal written english language, which makes it a great language for beginners to learn to program. 
Python can be usde for:
+ AI and machine learning,
+ Data analytics,
+ Data visualisation, .Programming applications,
+ Web development,
+ Game development,
+ Language development,
+ Finance,
+ SEO (search engine optmisation),
+ Design

### What is object orientated programming?

OOP is a type of programming paradigm, which refers to a way of thinking, or mindset when creating a program. OOP based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

An object is a thing that you want to store and process data about, such a car. The attributes of a car can be, make, colour, year, etc, and the methods (actions) could be, driving, braking, reversing, etc.

In python, a "class" is a blueprint that denotes what atributes and methods a distinct object will have. It also defines the way in which that object can interact with other things. In Python there are built in classes such as data types like strings, intergers and floats.  In this code - print("Hello") - "Hello" is an object of the 'class' called 'string'. The class 'string' denotes that it can't be added to an interger - print("Hello" + 1) will return an error. 

The four core concepts of OOP are:

Encapsulation - This groups related variables and functions together to reduce complexity and incrase usability. 

Abstraction - This hides details and complexity and shows only the essential code.

Inheritance - This allows sub classes to inherit attributes and methods from parent classes to eliminate redundant code.

Polymorphism - This translates to "many forms", and is a technique to get rid of long statements like elifs in python. Sub classes of a parent class can have a different 'arguements' for a 'method' using only one block of code. For example, "Animal' can be the parent class and 'dog', 'cat', and 'bird' can be sub classes of the 'Animal' class. The dog "barks", the cat "meows", and the bird "tweets" - these three actions can be executed using one block of code instead of a long statement. 




## Week 4

### What is a graph?

Nodes with lines connecting them. Nodes contain the data and the lines are what connects that data. Graphs can be directed (one way connection) or undirected (two way connection) or both. The simplest example I have found of an undirected grapgh in a real world scenario is the Faceebook (social graph) "friend" system. Users with all their information attached represent the nodes, and if two people are friends on facebook that will mean there is a two way connection between them (undirected). Additionally, Facebook can use this grapgh to implement features such as the 'friend request system'. It's a simple system that suggests to you mutual frinds of your current friends. An example of a directed grapgh is the world wide web (which can also be undirected). A webisite may have a link on their site to another website, but if that website doesn't have a link back to them, it's just a one way connection. 

In class today we made a video graph. There was a lack of cooperation from the class but I did get the jist of the exercise. Each person represented a node and the video feed of another person reresented the edge.  It was mostly a directed graph because the person you were filming would not also film you. Normally I dont like having the spotlight on me so being filmed makes me anxious, but because everyone else was also being filmed it lessened that anxiety a lot and I joined the hive mind of the group. People - especially gen z and millienials - have become very attached to their phones and it has become an extention of themselves. This became very noticiable for myself and probably many others in the class when we had to put our phones on the ground to be filmed. Photo galleries contain the most private parts of our lives, and that's exactly where my video was playing from. 




## Week 5

Agile. We are going to experience it in order to learn what it is.
The Agile model is the most widely used devopment methodology in the tech space. It's a set of principles and guidlines used to execute a project.

Them main for values of Agile are:
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change above following a plan

These four principles are pretty cool imo. I like how focused it is on people and the product itself. The entire process is so dynamic that it forces the developers to let go of their egos and be more open minded.

### What is an MVP? 

MVP stands for minimum viable product. It's an approach for testing and getting feedback on your product and its features. It doesn't have to be the product itself, it could be a wesite, an app, a video, or even be a crowd funding campaign to showcase your product to gain quality feedback with minimal time and expenses.

### How I would explain MVP to a 6 year old

Lets say you wanted to make a lemonade stand becuase you know you make the best lemonade and you also want to make some pocket money. But right noww you dont have money for the things you need to start the lemonade stand like cups, lemons, a stand, and a big jug of the lemonade, so you need to ask your parent for money. You might be worried that they wont give you any money to increase your chances of getting the money you can write out a list of why you want to make a lemonade stand, and you can also make one glass of lemonde to give your parents to show them it's the best! 

+ It's summer and everyone is thirsty
+ It's school holidays so all the kids and their parents are outside
+ A lot of people walk by your house so you might sell lots of lemonade

The list, and also the one glass of lemonade you give your parents is the MVP. All you needed was a pencil and paper, and you also had to make one glass of lemonade with ingredients that were already in the house, so it didnt cost you anything. If your parents like your idea of the lemonade stand they might give you the money to start it, and they might also give you some advice like adding two different sized cups. You can take their advice and make changes to your lemonade stand. 

### What is Timeboxing? Have you heard of it before? Will you use it?

"In Agile principles, timeboxing allocates a fixed and maximum unit of time to an activity, called a timebox, within which planned activity takes place. It is used by Agile principles-based project management approaches and for personal time management."

Up until googling "time boxing" right now, I had not heard of it. I do tend to ponder on unimportant matters so this would be a good tool to use in my own own life to help prioritise tasks. I dont work well under pressure generally, so introducing timeboxing should be good preparation for real world work environments. 

### Spaghetti tower challenge

Our task of creating teams and trying to build the tallest tower over three iterations, using raw spaghetti, tape, string and a marshmellow, was a good exercise to demonstrate why the agile model works well. Our first attemt failed, our second attempt also failed, and our third attempt was successful. During our first attempt, we made a plan together and allocated tasks, but we spent too much time on small details and were unable to make a finished tower. On our second attempt we didnt fuss over the small details and we made a finished tower but it didnt stand on its own. We found a bug at the end our second attempt that was making the taower topple over, and we were able to fix that bug and make the only free standing tower. Although we won and we had good teamwork, we still somewhat followed a more traditional approch to building the tower. A key element we were missing was an MVP. We were so focused on making the tallest people tower that we could and that which almost led to there being no tower at all. Our MVP would have been to make a free standing tower as fast as possible with minimal planning and time wasted, and from there we could have continued to make it taller with each itteration. 

### Reflection on the last five weeks

During week four and five I started to feel quite lost and confused abouth the direction of the course. Infact, I was so lost that stopped doing any study at all. I was trying to collect my thoughts in that time instead. My confusion was due to a misunderstanding about the course material and also the unorthodox teaching style that I wasn't used to. My expectation was that the class would be learning Python progressively each week during lectures, along with other things ofcourse, and that would ultimately lead to making projects with python. This confusion was due to the the older course outline I was given when I signed up for the course. After reaching out to you (Roman) regarding my concerns, The final thing you said to me was "trust the process". I've been doing so since that interaction and I've felt my confident with the direction of the course. I'm a bit behind schedule due to my 2 week break from study, but I have a rough idea of my plans. During that interaction you also sent me a link to a video about developing a growth mindset by Carol Dweck. That video made me better understand your teaching style and the course structure. You're trying to encourage a growth mindset with this course, and help students break free from the fixed mindset they might have. By choosing our own projects we are faced with challenge of aiming for a high goal, and you're encouraging us to explore that route and to not be afraid failure, and learn from it instead. I hope that if I do fail this assignment, I'm given the grade "Not yet".



## Week 6

I couldn't manage to get Koans running on my personal computer so I wasnt able to try that out. Instead I've been focusing on my repository and thinking about my project.

I have also just finished the python for beginners course on sololearn which was quite fun but also challenging and I'm looking foward to the intermmediate course. I'll share one of the many 'code projects' that you have to complete after learning about a new topic.

#### Prompt

You’re working on a search engine. Watch your back Google!
The given code takes a text and a word as input and passes them to a function called search().
The search() function should return "Word found" if the word is present in the text, or "Word not found", if it’s not.
Sample Input:
"This is awesome"
"awesome"
Sample Output:
Word found

#### Code:

def search(x,y):
   
   if y in x:
    
    return("Word found")
   
   else:
    
    return("Word not found")
   

text = input()

word = input()

print(search(text, word))


### My project ideas so far are:

+ A 2d platformer inspired by Hollow Knight made with pygame or a game engine like unity.
+ The Ai generated images gave me a cool idea. I thought that maybe I could generate random Prompts with python and feed it into the AI so it would produce something truly random and maybe awesome. If I had lists with 100 words per list and the list catorgories were nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions and articles, and I was able to write a code that spat out a gramatically correct description each time by picking one word from each list, then that might produce some cool images. Id execute it so You dont see the prompt the progrom generates until the images renders. 
+ My other idea is essentially the same thing except it would use web scraping to gather data instead of me inputting words myself. I'm not sure if youve heard of the 'library of babel", but its an online library that contains eerything that has been and will be said in the english language up to 3200 characters. it currently contains 10^4677 of books. For comparison, there are 10^80 atoms in the observable universe. Using that to somehow generate images would be awesome but maybe impossible.
+ I haven't started working on my project yet, but the first thing I plan to do is start making projects with python by following youtube tutorials and then see what I'm most drawn to. I'm quite excited about it. 


# Misc Prompts 

### Did you remember to take regular breaks away from your screen during this week? How often? Did you stretch your body?
I've been trying to make sure I take a break atleast every hour, even if Im confused about something and I know I'll likely spend my break time ruminating about my confusion. I have to make sure I take breaks so my mind stays clear and my body doesn't turn to stone. 


### On a a 0-5 scale, how confident are you with each of the assignments?

A 3/5

Software development is a bit overwhelming but I know once I'm more familiar with the process of making a project I'll feel more confident.


### What are of you proud of up to this point in the course?

Starting this course is the thing I'm most proud of so far. My last formal educational experience was in 2014 at university and that didn't pan out as I'd hoped, so signing up to this course was scary. 


### Do you have a personal learning strategy? If so, what parts of your learning strategy worked? What problems did you face? If you don't have a personal strategy yet, what do you think might work? Invent a describe a strategy for yourself. 

Learning for me is similar to reading a book. I need to be by myself in a quiet place with no distractions. My biggest hinderance is procrastination. I'll generally delay doing something if I find it boring or if I'm confused which makes beginning the task daunting. One strategy I've used in the past which has worked, is to set very small easily attainable goals. In this instance, the goal would be to 'study every day for 15 minutes'. Small goals like this work because it's not overwhelming. 15 minutes might not sound like much but that's not the part that matters, what matters is that once you've reached the 15 min mark, you've achieved the goal and you feel a little bit accomplished and proud of yourself. This creates a positive association with the activity which is easier for building a lasting habit. Even though the goal is only 15 minutes of study, you'll find that you'll usually study for a lot longer because it's only the 'starting' that's the hard part. Setting the goal to do it every day is another good hack because if you miss a day then you have the oppertunity to study again the next day and you're less likely to make excuses to 'start fresh the following week' for example. 


### Have you developed a habit of exploring?

I like to explore topics that interest me in my personal life. Admittedly, I haven't done as much exploring as I'd like to for this course. Due to the confusion and feeling a bit overwhelemed by developing, I put it off. I've stuck to learning python progressively, mainly through an app called 'sololearn' to get a better understanding of the language. I have begun to explore types of python projects through youtube videos and tutorials which is widening my perspective of what's possible. I haven't explored any other languages yet, but I'd like to start learning more front end web development specific languages like Javascript and also mark up languages like html and CSS as well as explore web design principles because I'd love to make fun and interactive websites.


### Have you meditated before?

I've dabbled in meditation over the last several years. Usually I practice the most basic form form of meditation. Essentially choosing an anchor to focus on, and when you notice your mind wondering, gently bringing your attention back to your anchor. I notice that the more I meditate, the more I start to notice when my mind has wondered in everyday life, and I can bring my attention back to the present moment. It's also been great for recognising and observing emotions as they arise, which has allowed me to respond calmly to situations that id usually react to negatively. The areas related to this field that fascinate me the most are conciousness and free will. How does matter give rise to conciousness and do we or dont we have free will. I fall into the camp that suggest we dont have free will, but I'd still love to see these questions answered in my lifetime. AI might have a huge role to play in answering these questions, and that's another field I'd like to explore. 


### Is there something over which you have gained a degree of mastery before in your life? Gymnastics, Rubik's Cubes, A Video Game? What did it take?

'Degree' being the key word here as I dont believe I've mastered anything yet. Two examples would be climbing a hard route almost perfectly and defeating a hard boss in a video game. It took a lot of hard work, creativity, and persistance for both things. One story/quote that always sticks with me regarding mastery and the time and energy it takes to aquire it is this one:

**_“It’s you — Picasso, the great artist! Oh, you must sketch my portrait! I insist.” -**

**_So Picasso agreed to sketch her. After studying her for a moment, he used a single pencil stroke to create her portrait. He handed the women his work of art. _**

**_“It’s perfect!” she gushed. “You managed to capture my essence with one stroke, in one moment. Thank you! How much do I owe you?” _**

**_“Five thousand dollars,” the artist replied.

**_“B-b-but, what?” the woman sputtered. “How could you want so much money for this picture? It only took you a second to draw it!” _**

**_To which Picasso responded, “Madame, it took me my entire life.” _**


### Do you consider yourself a developer yet?

As soon as I typed print(Hello, World!) and ran the program, I considered myself a programmer. I've come a little way since then and I have a long journey ahead of me. 


### How many tabs do you have open in your web browser right now? What is the ratio of study related tabs to distraction related tabs?

Currently I have 15 tabs open. If I open any more than that I cant decypher what any of them are. My laptop is a purely for study so there are no tabs open that can distract me. 


### Are you using the canvas content? Do you find it helpful or tedious?

I have read through some of the contents on canvas. I do find it quite helpful. I tend to search for other definitions and examples on the interent aswell so I can compare them and have a better understanding of the topics. The python modules on there werent very helpful to me though. Reading about how to code is quite confusing, and I prefer the online courses that have a lot more interaction and are fun as opposed to boring, which is what I thought abouth the modules. 


### Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?

Self doubt always finds a way of creeping in. The voice was saying "You wont get anything out of this course" and "Programming is way too hard, you wont be good enough to get a job". Math and  problem solving to the degree that programming requires, I thought to be out of my wheel house because I never gravitated towards them in school. This along with the confusion about the course I was experiencing led to these thoughts I believe. Did I believe those thoughts? To some degree I did, but I'm still in the course so I must have overcome it. 


### What is pair programming?

Pair programming is an Agile technique where two developers work together at the same work station. One perso writes code while the other person observes and reviews it. The two pair will alternate roles to they dont overwork themselves. The pair can solves problems together which minmises mistakes and one might have strenths where the other has weaknesses and vice versa. This would increase productivity and also makes work fun which is a bonus. 


### What is conscious listening?

Genuinely listening to the person. The more common thing to do amongst humans is preparing what you're going to say while the other person is speaking. Take in what they say with full comprehension.


### What is something kind that someone has done for you?

My flatmate makes me hot chocolates.


### What is something kind you have done for someone else?

I make my flatmate dinner often.
