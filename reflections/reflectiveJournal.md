## Week 1:

### What is Scratch?
It is a fun visual programming language that is used to create interactive games and stories. The concept of stacking blocks makes it intuitive and helps the user understanding progamming principles.

### What is visual programming?
A visual programming language is any programming language that lets users create programs by manipulating program elements graphically rather than by specifying them textually.

### What are some programming principles that you have discovered?
"Programming is simply a set of instructions to tell a computer how to perform a particular task". Programming languges are used as the "set of instructions", and there are many languages that have their own "syntax", but they all share the same purpose. There are 'low level' and 'high level' languages, the former being closer "machine code"  which the computer for can process directly (Computers understand 0's and 1's - binary - exclusively), and the latter being closer to noraml "human" language. Programming languages are 'compiled' and/or 'interpreted' in order to be translated into machine code.
Programming conventions - common rules, guidelines and approaches for programming languages - are the begining of the "programming principles" I'm becoming familiar with. 'Standard libraries' which defines the built-in functions and modules for a particular language are an important aspect of high level languages. "Style guides", seem to be synonymous with "syntax" so I may need to follow up on that if it's important. Variables are place holders for information, and each varibale stores just one piece of information. They store data types which can be numeric, text (strings) or booleans (True or False values). 
 "A flowchart is a simple diagram that illustrates the stages or steps the computer must complete to solve the problem". These visual representations of code are easier to grasp than normal written code (pseudo code). Scratch is similar to a flow chart in many ways. seeing the visual elements of flow charts such as sequence, condition and itteration, make 'control flow' concepts like "while loops" in 'Python'(or any other language) easier to understand. 


### Can you share your favourite Scratch project that you have made or remixed?
Yes i can.

## Week 2:

### What is git?
A dictionary defines a 'git' as "an unpleasant or contemptible person".
or "Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development."

### What is GitHub?
